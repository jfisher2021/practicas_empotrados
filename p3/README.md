# Coffee Machine Project
This project is a coffee machine simulation implemented using an Arduino board and various sensors and actuators. The coffee machine allows users to select different types of coffee, adjust the price of each coffee, and provides an administration mode for monitoring temperature, humidity, and distance using an LCD display.

## Installation
To set up the coffee machine project, follow these steps:

Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
Install the necessary libraries for the LCD display, temperature and humidity sensor, and distance sensor.
Upload the code provided in this repository to the Arduino board.
## Usage
Once the code is uploaded to the Arduino board, you can use the coffee machine as follows:

Power on the coffee machine.
The LCD display will show the initial screen with the available coffee options.
Use the push buttons to navigate through the coffee options.
Press the select button to choose a coffee.
The coffee machine will start preparing the selected coffee, displaying the progress on the LCD display.
Once the coffee is ready, the LCD display will prompt you to remove the drink.
After removing the drink, the coffee machine will return to the initial screen.
To access the administration mode, tilt the coffee machine to a specific angle.
In the administration mode, you can monitor temperature, humidity, and distance using the LCD display.
Use the push buttons to navigate through the administration options.
Press the select button to view the selected administration option.
To adjust the price of a coffee, enter the price adjustment mode by tilting the coffee machine to a specific angle.
In the price adjustment mode, use the tilt angle to increase or decrease the price of the selected coffee.
Press the select button to save the price adjustment.
To exit the administration mode, press the select button.
